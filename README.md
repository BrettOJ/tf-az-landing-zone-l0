Creating a Terraform landing zone for Azure resources using modules and hosting it on GitHub involves several steps. A landing zone is essentially an environment configuration that defines how your Azure resources should be provisioned and managed. To get started, follow these step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment**

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your local machine:

-   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
-   [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

**Step 2: Create a New GitHub Repository**

Create a new GitHub repository to host your Terraform landing zone modules. You can do this through the GitHub website or by using the following steps:

1.  Log in to GitHub.
2.  Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
3.  Follow the prompts to create your repository, including giving it a name, description, and choosing visibility (public or private).

**Step 3: Clone the Repository**

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

```

Replace `yourusername` and `your-repository` with your GitHub username and repository name.

**Step 4: Organize Your Project Structure**

Inside your local repository directory, create the following directory structure to organize your Terraform landing zone modules:

```
luayour-repository/
|-- modules/
|   |-- module1/
|   |   |-- main.tf
|   |   |-- variables.tf
|   |   |-- outputs.tf
|   |-- module2/
|   |   |-- main.tf
|   |   |-- variables.tf
|   |   |-- outputs.tf
|-- main.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- outputs.tf
|-- README.md

```

This structure separates modules into subdirectories for easier management.

**Step 5: Write Terraform Configuration**

Within each module directory (`module1`, `module2`, etc.), write your Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`) to define the Azure resources you want to provision and manage.

**Step 6: Create a Main Configuration File**

In the root directory of your repository, create a main Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) that uses the modules you've defined. This file will orchestrate the provisioning of resources across your landing zone.

**Step 7: Commit and Push to GitHub**

After writing your Terraform configurations, commit and push your code to GitHub:

```
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master

```

**Step 8: Initialize and Apply Terraform**

Now, you can initialize and apply Terraform within your local repository to provision the Azure resources:

```
bashterraform init
terraform apply

```

**Step 9: Configure Terraform Backend**

To store Terraform state remotely, you may want to configure a Terraform backend, such as Azure Storage or AWS S3. Update your `main.tf` to include a backend configuration.

**Step 10: Automate Deployment (Optional)**

Consider using CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or Jenkins to automate the deployment process whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

**Step 11: Documentation**

Write a `README.md` file in the root directory of your repository to document how to use your Terraform landing zone and any prerequisites.

**Step 12: Collaborate and Maintain**

Collaborate with your team to improve and maintain the Terraform landing zone as your project evolves.

Remember to follow best practices for managing Terraform configurations, including version control, code review, and security considerations.
